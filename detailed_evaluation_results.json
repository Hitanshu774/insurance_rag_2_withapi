This suggests that **Markellm** is Insurellm\u2019s marketplace product, designed to connect insurers with qualified shoppers through data-driven lead generation.\n\n### **Infrastructure Products (Core Portals & Support Systems)**\nInsurellm\u2019s core products appear to serve as infrastructure for insurers, including:\n1. **Carllm** \u2013 Auto insurance platform\n2. **Homellm** \u2013 Home insurance platform\n3. **Lifellm** \u2013 Life insurance platform with AI underwriting\n4. **Healthllm** \u2013 Health insurance platform\n5. **Bizllm** \u2013 Commercial insurance platform\n6. **Claimllm** \u2013 Claims processing platform (mentioned in the expansion)\n\nAdditionally, the context highlights **multi-channel integration** and a **customer portal** for policy/claims management, which could be considered part of their infrastructure offerings.\n\n### **Support & Updates**\nInsurellm also provides:\n- **24/7 dedicated support**\n- **Regular platform updates** (security, features, mobile apps)\n- **Marketing assistance** (quarterly strategy consultations, trend reports)\n\nIf you're looking for more details on a specific product (e.g., Markellm\u2019s marketplace features or backend infrastructure), I\u2019d be happy to help clarify further!
